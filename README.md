Part Artist Part Scientist

I thought the only thing I'd ever love to do in this world was make music. I've now taken another lover and she currently speaks to me in Java, JAvascipt, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and AngularJS. I met her on a  dating site called Nodejs. She told me she wants to teach me Python, Ruby and Swift. Our favorite topic of discussion is making Hybrid Native apps with Cordova and Ionic.
